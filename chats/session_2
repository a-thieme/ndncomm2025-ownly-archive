Brilliant work. I'm very interested in how to efficiently pin scheduling to a local geographic area, for some locally efficiency.

/ndn/net/pollere/nichols4/17/2025, 10:39 AM
Perhaps if the identity includes geographic area?

/ndn/com/operantnetworks/andrew.bartels4/17/2025, 10:41 AM
Maybe! Also eventually if multiple scheduled resources take on the task, there would need to be a way to correlate independent compute results.

Nice Work.. Thanks!.. However, Tasks DAG could be complex, specially with Genomic studies.. Would like to look (Contribute) into performance stats (and contribute for optimization).. for dense DAGs..

(I thought we were still in sessions 1? I suppose this one is created for session 2, the panel)

Aha, thanks for pointing this out Lixia. I think perhaps we were misled because the discussion popped up when the speaker going going

Oops, sorry for the confusion. Section 2 starts in the afternoon. Section 2: Invited Talks: Looking into the Big Picture Internet

Just realized I put it in the wrong channel

Session 2 starting now?

/ndn/edu/ucla/g/stheera4/17/2025, 2:07 PM
Yes

Would be interesting to see if there is a way to connect traditional cloud (e.g., to continue to use AWS Sagemaker or cloud-based generative models) to NDN through some sort of connector!

please follow NDNComm Schedule (on Ownly) for break time (it's really convenient to have the schedule online which can be dynamically adjusted)

Geoff already left the meeting: my comment about disagreeing with half of his talk is a bit joking. Seriously, not disagreement but additional interpretations on the observations Geoff made: DNS names are ruling the internet communications.

Website schedule needs to sync from Ownly.
