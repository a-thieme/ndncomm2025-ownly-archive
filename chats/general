hi

/ndn/edu/ucla/cs/lixia4/17/2025, 9:59 AM
great to see people trying this out. Hope others will join here too. Please feel free to bring up any questions anyone may have


/ndn/gov/treasury/ofr/michael.warner4/17/2025, 10:04 AM
Would it be possible to braid ownly domains together? i.e. if you have a ownly space for your zipcode, you could inherit groups from your state and national senators, congress people etc.. the idea is a single geofenced ID would 'pre-join' blended clusters of pre-established community spaces?

michael.warner: ownly is more or less a platform in its beginning form, with secure data delivery and data synchronization within the group. We would like to see people build more functions as desired. Please feel free to voice your questions on zoom

/ndn/gov/treasury/ofr/michael.warner4/17/2025, 10:14 AM

ownly.work is $7.18/year.

Cheapest domain would be $1/year (including ICANN fees).

/ndn/edu/arizona/shijunxiao4/17/2025, 12:37 PM
But, DNS authority is centralized. zoom.us got serverHold yesterday because error in the registry.

/ndn/edu/arizona/shijunxiao4/17/2025, 12:39 PM
NDN team should start an NDN registry, charge a reasonable fee per name per year. Don't piggyback on other DNS names.\

hey all! might've missed that (was too late for the talk), but where can i find a paper/docs about Ownly app design ? thanks

/ndn/edu/arizona/shijunxiao4/17/2025, 12:54 PM
We are hoping the slides get uploaded to PROJECTS - documents section.

/ndn/io/gusev/peter4/17/2025, 12:55 PM
cool thanks

/ndn/com/protonmail/cxres%2Bndn4/17/2025, 1:05 PM
Are these talks being recorded. It's quite late here in India and I would like to go to bed and catch up with the remaining talks in the morning.

/ndn/com/gmail/davidepesa4/17/2025, 2:07 PM

Could this be used as a more scalable and more secure version of things like ZeroTier? Looks like it could.

/ndn/com/operantnetworks/andrew.bartels4/17/2025, 5:31 PM
How might this stratgy apply to a post-quantum crypto world?

/ndn/edu/ucla/cs/lixia4/17/2025, 9:46 PM
Please note: discussions for a specific session are in channel specific channels.

/ndn/edu/ucla/cs/lixia4/18/2025, 11:31 AM
