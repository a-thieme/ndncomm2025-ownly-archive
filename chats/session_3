Session discussions of "NDN Forwarding and Routing"

/ndn/edu/ucla/cs/lixia4/17/2025, 4:47 PM

I brought Andrew Bartels question from zoom to here: Andrew Bartels to Everyone (Apr 17, 2025, 4:44â€¯PM) Could you apply this onto a mixed network, including cellular networks where there might be data limits?

I did test the basic functionality of NDNd+dv on AS200690, but decided that it's not ready for worldwide deployment. The main missing feature is security validation of prefix registration commands.

/ndn/edu/ucla/cs/lixia4/17/2025, 4:50 PM
yes ndn-dv can be applied to mixed network. it is better suited for cellular with data limit than link-state given distance vector can have much lower overhead. A different version of distance vector, landmark routing, can further reduce overhead significantly.

I never understood the concept of engine.

It appears that NDNd stdlib wanted to support multiple codecs, but this idea doesn't work well.

We don't trust benchmarks performed on a single machine. Gotta use separate hosts for consumer - forwarder - producer.

True, this benchmark was just trying to compare the original 2021 numbers (but those are likely not right anyway). The benchmark is mostly just measuring forwarding rate.

Codecs?

    Codecs?

Will there be a feature in the future to mention someone (i.e. @ someone) in an ownly chat room?

oh, my profile icon is sad

well, mine is sick so...

I have the biggest smile.
